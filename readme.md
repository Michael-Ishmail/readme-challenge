Attached is my Node.js challenge. In this program, the user will use Node.js to generate a readme.md file for their project. Once the command is executed to begin the application, the user will be prompted with several questions regarding their project. The answers to these questions will be stored, and that data will be used to generate a readme file for the user to use.

Below is a demonstration of the program, as well as the GitHub repository link. I have included two demo videos in the demo folder. One is in an MP4 format and the other is in a GIF format.

I was asked to resubmit the assignent with a link to my demo on a video streaming platform. My previous submission only had the demo file videos uploaded to the repository. Below is a link to a youtube video showcasing my code.
